# Markdown Practice

### Dear Nico,
I  have _finally_ begun the task of learning something. Markdown is pretty neat because I can do all these **cool** things.

Here is a pic of Cosmo ![Cosmo](https://imgur.com/m9H0Jt0.jpg)  

Oh and you should follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/logiew)

As I am writing this I got a message from you that says:
>"Did Jeremy go bed"

BTW you should do some stuff tomorrow like
* work on SWM  
* tell Cosmo I said hi 
* wash your car that you don't have  
* try and get your 10k back :>

Lastly, thanks for the [song][a bop] recommendation

That is all. Bye!!
